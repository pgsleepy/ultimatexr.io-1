# Submitting a Simple Edit

If you notice a typo, outdated information, or have an improvement, submitting a simple edit is fast and straightforward.<br>
You will not need to set up any type of development environment. You will only need a _GitHub_ account.

The steps to contribute a simple edit is as follows:<br>

## 1. Navigate to the repository

To begin, navigate to the documentation repository. You can do this either manually or by clicking the "**Edit this page on GitHub**" link located in the right-hand menu of the article you want to edit.

If you're logged in, you'll see the markdown code for the page. It should look something like this:
![](/media/docs/contributing-to-the-guide/submitting-a-simple-edit/01EditThisPage.png)

## 2. Editing the file

You can now make your edits directly within the file. Modify the markdown content as needed.<br>
Once you're done, click the green "**Commit changes**" button at the top-right corner of the page:

## 3. Propose changes

Next, you'll be prompted to propose your changes. This step requires a commit message and an optional extended description.<br>
The commit message should be clear and concise, summarizing the purpose of the edit (e.g., "Fix typo in introduction"). This serves as the main log for the update.

## 4. Compare changes and create pull request.

GitHub will automatically create a new branch for your changes. Now, you can review the edits and create a pull request.

A pull request is a request for the repository maintainers to merge your changes into the official documentation. For a simple edit, you can keep the default title and description. However, for more complex edits, make sure your title and description are as clear and detailed as possible.

Once you're satisfied, click the "**Create pull request**" button to submit your changes for review.

Congratulations! You've successfully submitted your changes. The maintainers will review them and, if everything checks out, merge them into the main documentation.

You can view examples of other contributions on the [Pull Requests page on GitHub](https://github.com/VRMADA/ultimatexr.io/pulls)
