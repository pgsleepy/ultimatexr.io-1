# UxrGrabbableObject

## Introduction

The `UxrGrabbableObject` component, when added to a GameObject, allows the object to be manipulated by `UxrGrabber` components found in the hands of a `UxrAvatar`.

{{% callout info %}}
The full API can be explored in the [UxrGrabbableObject API Reference](/api/T_UltimateXR_Manipulation_UxrGrabbableObject) and the user guide can be found in the [UxrGrabbableObject Component Guide](/docs/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobject).

Some key features include:
- **Automatic handling**: Manipulation is seamlessly managed by the `UxrGrabManager`. Once added to the scene, the grab manager handles all interactions automatically.
- **Grab, release, and place**: Objects can be grabbed, released in mid-air, or placed onto compatible `UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor` components when released close to one.
- **Multiple grab points**: Objects can be grabbed from different points, and additional grab points can be defined using `UxrGrabPointShape` components to enable more complex interactions.
- **Avatar-specific customization**: Interactions can be customized for different avatars by registering snap points and poses specifically for each avatar.
- **Hand Pose Editor support**: The Hand Pose Editor can create poses that are previewed and edited directly in the inspector window, ensuring objects are grabbed in the intended way.
- **Event support**: Events such as `Grabbed`, `Released`, and `Placed` allow custom logic to be executed when users interact with the object. Each event has both pre and post versions.
- **Constraints support**: Use events like `ConstraintsApplying`, `ConstraintsApplied`, and `ConstraintsFinished` to implement more complex behavior when objects are being manipulated.

We've divided the grabbable object programming guide into functional sections to make the information easier to navigate and access. Each section focuses on a specific area, such as hierarchy, constraints, grabbing mechanics, and more, allowing you to quickly find the details relevant to your needs.

## General Functionality

This section covers basic properties and methods that define the object's general behavior.

### Properties

- `int` `Priority`  
  Defines the object's priority for being grabbed when multiple objects are within reach.
- `bool` `AllowMultiGrab`  
  Allows the object to be grabbed by multiple grabbers at the same time.
- `bool` `IsLockedInPlace`  
  Indicates if the object is locked in place and cannot be moved.

### Methods

- `void` `ResetPositionAndState(bool propagateEvents)`  
  Resets the object’s position and state, optionally propagating events.

## Grabbable Hierararchy

This section focuses on how the grabbable object interacts with other grabbable parent or child objects in a hierarchy, controlling dependencies and manipulation across multiple objects.

A special case of a parent is a dummy parent grabbable parent.

{{% callout info %}}
A dummy parent is a parent object with an `UxrGrabbableObject` component that can only be manipulated through its children but still has its own movement and rotation constraints.
{{% /callout %}}

For example, in a door and handle setup, the door is the parent and the handle is the grabbable object. By enabling the `ControlParentDirection` property (or using the inspector), the handle can control the door’s aperture without the door being directly grabbable. You can enable the `IsDummyGrabbableParent` property (or using the inspector) to set up constraints for the parent without requiring grab points.

Other examples include an aircraft yoke, where the yoke column rotates as the child yoke object is manipulated.

- `bool` `ControlParentDirection`  
  Determines whether the object's manipulation controls the parent’s direction through a look-at to the child.
