# Events

## Introduction

UltimateXR provides an event-based system for its manipulation module that allows developers to respond to specific actions and interactions. These events can be tied to grabbing, releasing, or interacting with objects, giving you full control over how your application reacts to them.

You can access these events in two ways: 

1. **Using [UxrGrabManager](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabmanager)**: This lets you track all object interactions.
2. **Directly from a [UxrGrabbableObject](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobject) or [UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobjectanchor)**: To track events for a specific object.

We’ll also cover [UxrGrabbableObjectComponent](#uxrgrabbableobjectcomponentdocsprogramming-guidemanipulationuxrgrabbableobjectcomponent-events), which allows you to handle events by overriding specific methods through inheritance.

## Manipulation Events in UltimateXR

Events in UltimateXR use standard C# event mechanics. You subscribe to events when needed and unsubscribe when they are no longer necessary. Here’s an example of how to detect when an object is grabbed:

```c#
public class MyGrabLogger : MonoBehaviour
{
	private void OnEnable()
	{
		// Subscribe to event
		UxrGrabManager.Instance.ObjectGrabbed += UxrGrabManager_ObjectGrabbed;
	}

	private void OnDisable()
	{
		// Unsubscribe from event
		UxrGrabManager.Instance.ObjectGrabbed -= UxrGrabManager_ObjectGrabbed;
	}
	
	// This is the event handling method. It receives manipulation event arguments.
	private void UxrGrabManager_ObjectGrabbed(object sender, UxrManipulationEventArgs e)
	{
		Debug.Log($"Object {e.GrabbableObject.name} was grabbed");
	}
}
```

In the example above, the `MyGrabLogger` component subscribes to the *Grabbed* event when first activated, and unsubscribes from it when being destroyed. The component will print a message on the log window every time a component is grabbed.

We recommend two approaches for handling events:

1. **Subscribe during `OnEnable()`, unsubscribe during `OnDisable()`**: Use this when you want event notifications only while the component is enabled. 
2. **Subscribe during `Awake()` or `Start()`, unsubscribe during `OnDestroy()`**: Use this when you need event notifications even while the component is disabled or inactive.

The first approach is usually recommended because, in most cases, a disabled component should not process or handle any data.

{{% callout caution %}}
Not unsubscribing from events can lead to null reference exceptions. This happens because the event handling method will still be called on an object that has been deleted.

### Pre and Post Event Naming

UltimateXR follows the [.Net Event Naming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-type-members#names-of-events) conventions. Especifically these 3 rules:
1. DO name events with a verb or a verb phrase. Examples include `Clicked`, `Painting`, `DroppedDown`, and so on.
2. DO give events names with a concept of before and after, **using the present and past tenses**.
3. DO NOT use "Before" or "After" prefixes or postfixes to indicate pre- and post-events. Use present and past tenses as just described.

## [UxrGrabManager](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabmanager) Events
These events are raised whenever any element in the scene activates them. They all receive a `UxrManipulationEventArgs` object that contains specific manipulation information about the event. Depending on which event is being raised, some fields may be left unused. For example, a *Grabbed* will never use the `UxrManipulationEventArgs.ReleaseVelocity` property.

The `UxrManipulationEventArgs` class has the following properties:

- **IsGrabbedStateChanged**: Indicates whether the object switched between being grabbed and not being grabbed, filtering out cases where it's still grabbed by another hand.
- **EventType**: The type of event (e.g., grabbing, releasing).
- **GrabbableObject**: The object involved in the manipulation.
- **GrabbableAnchor**: The anchor related to the event.
- **Grabber**: The entity performing the action.
- **GrabPointIndex**: The grab point index for the object.
- **IsMultiHands**: Indicates if more than one hand is involved.
- **IsSwitchHands**: Indicates if the object was passed between hands.
- **ReleaseVelocity**: The release velocity.
- **ReleaseAngularVelocity**: The angular velocity on release.
- **PlacementOptions**: The placement flags in place events.

Check the following sections of the API reference for more information:
- [UxrGrabManager Events](/api/T_UltimateXR_Manipulation_UxrGrabManager#events)
- [UxrManipulationEventArgs Properties](/api/T_UltimateXR_Manipulation_UxrManipulationEventArgs#properties) are used.

### GrabTrying
Raised when the user presses the grab action button on the controller, indicating an attempt to grab. This doesn’t necessarily mean an object is within reach; it just shows that the user has pressed the button.

### ObjectGrabbing/ObjectGrabbed
Raised right before an object is being grabbed (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectGrabbing`) and after (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectGrabbed`).

### ObjectReleasing/ObjectReleased
Raised when an object begins to be released (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectReleasing`) and after it is released (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectReleased`). If the object is released near a compatible and empty anchor, it will raise a Placed event instead.

### ObjectPlacing/ObjectPlaced
Raised right before an object is being placed on an anchor (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectPlacing`) and after (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectPlaced`).

### ObjectRemoving/ObjectRemoved
Raised right before an object is being grabbed or removed from its anchor (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectRemoving`) and after (`UxrGrabManager.ObjectRemoved`).

### AnchorRangeEntering/AnchorRangeLeft
Raised when a grabbed object enters (`UxrGrabManager.AnchorRangeEntering`) or leaves (`UxrGrabManager.AnchorRangeLeft`) the proximity of an empty anchor, meaning it can be placed.

### PlacedObjectRangeEntered/PlacedObjectRangeLeft
Raised when an empty grabber enters (`UxrGrabManager.PlacedObjectRangeEntered`) or leaves (`UxrGrabManager.PlacedObjectRangeLeft`) the range of a grabbable object that is placed on an anchor, meaning it can be grabbed.

## [UxrGrabbableObject](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobject) Events
These events are raised for a specific [UxrGrabbableObject](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobject). They also receive a `UxrManipulationEventArgs` object, which will contain specific manipulation information depending on the event.
Check the [UxrGrabbableObject Event API Reference](/api/T_UltimateXR_Manipulation_UxrGrabbableObject#events) to see how the events work and how the properties are used.

### ConstraintsApplying/ConstraintsApplied/ConstraintsFinished

These events are raised during the manipulation module's update stage, allowing access to `Transform` data and apply custom constraints by modifying the position and rotation of a grabbable object.

The [UxrGrabbableObject](/docs/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobject) component has built-in constraint support for specifying linear and rotational limits. However, constraint events are useful for:
- Custom constraints that go beyond built-in limits.
- Applying linear or rotational vibrations (e.g., firearm recoil in UltimateXR) as an effect.
- Visualizing the real hand’s position when the distance from the constrained hand exceeds a set threshold.

{{% callout info %}}
Using events instead of the component’s `Update()` method ensures that `Transform` changes occur at the correct stage in the manipulation workflow.
{{% /callout %}}

- **`UxrGrabbableObject.ConstraintsApplying`**: This event is raised just before applying the built-in position and rotation constraints to the object. It can be used to store unconstrained `Transform` values.
- **`UxrGrabbableObject.ConstraintsApplied`**: This event is raised immediately after the built-in constraints are applied to the object. Normally you add your custom constraints code here.
- **`UxrGrabbableObject.ConstraintsFinished`**: This event is raised after `UxrGrabbableObject.ConstraintsApplied`, ensuring that all subscribed handlers have been executed.

Learn more about constraint events in the [Handling Constraints](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/handling-constraints) programming section.

### Grabbing/Grabbed
Raised right before an object is being grabbed (`UxrGrabbableObject.Grabbing`) and after (`UxrGrabbableObject.Grabbed`).

### Releasing/Released
Raised when an object starts to be released (`UxrGrabbableObject.Releasing`) and after (`UxrGrabbableObject.Released`). If the object is released near a compatible and empty anchor, it will raise a Placed event instead.

### Placing/Placed
Raised right before an object is being placed on an anchor (`UxrGrabbableObject.Placing`) and after (`UxrGrabbableObject.Placed`).

## [UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobjectanchor) Events
These events are raised for a specific [UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobjectanchor). Like with `UxrGrabbableObject`, they also receive a `UxrManipulationEventArgs` object with parameters.
Check the [UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor Event API Reference](/api/T_UltimateXR_Manipulation_UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor#events) to see how the events work and how the properties are used.

### Placing/Placed
Raised right before an object is being placed on an anchor (`UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor.Placing`) and after (`UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor.Placed`).

### Removing/Removed
Raised right before an object is being grabbed or removed from its anchor (`UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor.Removing`) and after (`UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor.Removed`).

### SmoothPlaceTransitionEnded
Raised right after the smooth transition of an object placement is complete. The manipulation system uses transitions to smooth object movement. For place events, `UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor.Placed` is raised first, followed by `UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor.SmoothPlaceTransitionEnded` after the transition finishes.

## [UxrGrabbableObjectComponent](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobjectcomponent) Events

The base `UxrGrabbableObjectComponent` class provides a convenient way to implement manipulation logic by overriding methods instead of manually subscribing to events.

Components created this way automatically process events for the `UxrGrabbableObject` in the same GameObject. Inheriting from this class has several benefits:
- Less code is needed, resulting in more compact and readable components.
- It ultimately derives from `UxrComponent`, which adds a lot of functionality automatically.

Here is an example that processes Grabbed and Released events:
```c#
// Inherit from UxrGrabbableObjectComponent to get access to the functionality.
public class MyComponent : UxrGrabbableObjectComponent<MyComponent>
{
	// Override to get called right after the object was grabbed.
	protected override void OnObjectGrabbed(UxrManipulationEventArgs e)
	{
		Debug.Log("Grabbed");
	}

	// Override to get called right after the object was released.
	protected override void OnObjectReleased(UxrManipulationEventArgs e)
	{
		Debug.Log("Released");
	}
}
```
