# Overview

In a VR application, a crucial step is to add an avatar to the scenes.

An avatar serves as the user's visual representation within the application. At its core, it consists of a single camera allowing exploration of the virtual environment. However, avatars can include additional elements like hands for interaction or a complete body for immersion.

A very special avatar is the **local avatar**, which is the avatar controlled directly by the user. Non-local avatars, on the other hand, are controlled externally; they can represent the user during a replay or other users in a network setting.

When integrating avatars, two main options are available:

1. Using any of the built-in avatar prefabs provided by UltimateXR
2. Creating an avatar from scratch.

Let's explore the two options in the next sections.
