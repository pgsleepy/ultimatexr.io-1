# Principles

UltimateXR was envisioned from the beginning as an accessible yet robust and scalable framework. When it comes to code, our goal has always been to maintain the highest standards.

Here are some of the guiding principles behind our development:

- Even the smallest contribution can save countless hours for fellow developers.
- We prioritize writing well-structured, clean code. Our framework code is intended for use across numerous projects and by countless developers over the years. It's our aim to create the API we'd want to use ourselves.
- Documentation is a top priority:
  - Each class, method, event, or property is meticulously documented using standard XML tags. Whether public, protected, or private, this practice ensures that programmers can access contextual help in their IDE whenever they interact with any UltimateXR class or member. Moreover, it lays the foundation for automatically generating API documentation on this website.
  - In longer code sections, we insert comments at regular intervals to outline the flow of the algorithm. This not only compartmentalizes the logic but also provides a quick overview of each segment's purpose, enhancing readability.
- Every line of code in the framework serves a purpose, originating from real-world project requirements. This approach naturally shapes the API to align with practical use cases.
- We adhere to standards wherever feasible, mostly from the .NET Framework [Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/).
- To maintain consistency throughout the framework, we employ a uniform file structure and coding style. Presently, we utilize Rider and its code style capabilities, having previously utilized Resharper for Visual Studio. In the future, we may offer these configuration files to streamline external contributions.
