# UxrAvatar

The `UxrAvatar` component provides properties, methods, and events to control avatars at runtime. The full API can be explored on the [UxrAvatar API Reference](/api/T_UltimateXR_Avatar_UxrAvatar#uxravatar-class) and the user guide can be found in the [UxrAvatar component guide](/docs/avatars/uxravatar).

The static `UxrAvatar.LocalAvatar` property allows you to access the `UxrAvatar` component representing the user, from anywhere in the code. It returns the first avatar in the scene with the `AvatarMode` property set to `Local`.

There are other static properties that provide shortcuts to frequently used elements from the local avatar, such as `UxrAvatar.LocalAvatarInput` and `UxrAvatar.LocalAvatarCamera`. They will all be described in the following sections.

Below is a list of the most relevant UxrAvatar elements that are commonly used, by category.

## Avatar Mode

Avatars can either be local or external. Typically, there is one avatar in the scene, the local avatar, which has its `AvatarMode` property set to `Local`. This avatar is controlled directly by the user with the connected VR device.

In multiplayer sessions, however, additional avatars are spawned in the scene. These external avatars are not controlled by any connected devices; instead, they are updated using networking data. These avatars have their `AvatarMode` set to `UpdateExternally`.

Avatars with their `AvatarMode` set to `UpdateExternally` are limited to features like inverse kinematics and other cosmetic functionalities. These external avatars can be seen as puppets, as they are controlled by external processes instead of their avatar controller. Common scenarios where avatars are updated externally include multiplayer remote clients and replay sessions.

### Static Properties

- `LocalAvatar`: Gets the avatar that represents the user, controlled using the connected VR device.

### Properties

- `AvatarMode`: Gets the mode of a given avatar, either `Local` or `UpdateExternally`.

### Examples

Example that uses `LocalAvatar` to get the avatar position from anywhere in the code:
```c#
Debug.Log($"The user avatar is at {UxrAvatar.LocalAvatar.transform.position}.");
```

## Avatar Controller

The avatar controller a the component on the same GameObject as the `UxrAvatar` component and is responsible for updating the avatar using all the functionality that it supports.

While UltimateXR allows developers to create their own `UxrAvatarController` for added flexibility, most users will use the built-in `UxrStandardAvatarController` component, which provides access to important features like inverse kinematics (IK), grabbing, UI interaction, and more.

### Static Properties

- `LocalStandardAvatarController`: This property attempts to retrieve the local avatar's controller, provided it uses the built-in `UxrStandardAvatarController` type.

### Properties

- `AvatarController`: Gets the avatar's controller, which is responsible for updating the avatar.

## Avatar Rendering

Although the appearance of avatars is determined by the user, UltimateXR has a cool feature that allows to display hands and controllers to visualize the current state of user input.

To toggle between showing the avatar and the controllers, you can combine the `UxrAvatarRenderModes` flags: `LeftController`, `RightController`, and `Avatar`. There are also pre-defined combinations such as `AllControllers` and `AllControllersAndAvatar` for convenience.

When displaying controllers, you can also decide whether to show a virtual hand that mirrors the user’s real-time hand movements, using Inverse Kinematics, by setting the `ShowControllerHands` property.

### Properties

- `RenderMode`: This property controls whether to render the avatar or the controllers, by combining different `UxrAvatarRenderModes` flags.
- `ShowControllerHands`: When displaying controllers, it decides whether to also show a virtual hand that mirrors the user’s real-time hand movements.
- `AvatarRenderers`: This property accesses the list of avatar renderers.

### Methods

- `GetAllAvatarRendererComponents()`: This method retrieves all Renderer components in the avatar except those hanging from a `UxrHandIntegration` object, which represent the controllers and the controller hands.

## Avatar Rig

The following properties and methods give access to information about the avatar rig.

### Properties

- `AvatarRigType`: Determines if the avatar consists of just two hands or a half/full body.
- `AvatarRig`: Accesses the `UxrAvatarRig` object, which holds all bone references and includes features like resolving missing bones and animating the hands.
- `AvatarRigInfo`: Provides detailed information about the avatar's rig, including distances, axes, and points of interest.
- `LeftHand`: A shortcut to `AvatarRig.LeftArm.Hand`, containing references to all the `Transform` objects in the left hand and fingers.
- `RightHand`: A shortcut to `AvatarRig.RightArm.Hand`, containing references to all the `Transform` objects in the right hand and fingers.
- `LeftHandBone`: A shortcut to the `Transform` of the left hand's wrist (`AvatarRig.LeftArm.Hand.Wrist`).
- `RightHandBone`: A shortcut to the `Transform` of the right hand's wrist (`AvatarRig.LeftArm.Hand.Wrist`).

### Methods

- `GetInitialBoneLocalPosition()`: Retrieves the initial local position of a bone in the avatar rig.
- `GetInitialBoneLocalRotation()`: Retrieves the initial local rotation of a bone in the avatar rig.
- `GetArm()`: Provides access to the arm structure of the avatar, including the shoulder, elbow, and hand.
- `GetHand()`: Returns the hand object for either the left or right hand, depending on the input parameter.
- `GetHandBone()`: Returns the wrist bone for either the left or right hand, based on the input.
- `SetupRigElementsFromAnimator()`: Sets up the rig elements by reading humanoid data from the `Animator` component.
- `ClearRigElements()`: Clears the current rig elements, effectively removing references to bones and transforms.
- `TryToInferMissingRigElements()`: Attempts to automatically infer any missing rig elements by analyzing the avatar's structure.

## Avatar Camera

All avatars have a camera that, when the avatar is in `Local` mode, will render the view from the avatar.

### Static Properties

- `LocalAvatarCamera`: Gets the local avatar's `Camera` component.
- `LocalOrFirstEnabledCamera`: This property get the local avatar's camera. If there is no local avatar, it returns the first camera found in the enabled `UpdateExternally` avatars. If no enabled avatars are present, it will return `Camera.main`. This can be useful for observing during multiplayer sessions or replays, where there are no avatars controlled by XR devices.

### Properties

- `CameraComponent`: Accesses the `Camera` component from the avatar.
- `CameraTransform`: Retrieves the transform of the avatar’s camera.
- `CameraPosition`: Returns the world position of the avatar’s camera.
- `CameraFloorPosition`: Returns the position of the avatar’s camera, projected on the floor.
- `CameraForward`: Returns the forward direction of the avatar’s camera.
- `ProjectedCameraForward`: Returns the avatar’s forward camera direction projected onto the horizontal plane.
- `CameraController`: Accesses the camera's parent.
- `CameraFade`: Gets the component that manages color fade effects for the avatar.

### Methods

- `IsLookingAt()`: Determines if the avatar’s camera is looking at a specific point or object.

## Input/Tracking

The input and tracking components are responsible for collecting input and positional data from the controllers. In UltimateXR, each avatar contains a special GameObject called **HandsIntegration**, which holds the input and tracking components for all supported devices. The goal of this system is to automatically handle the setup, so users don’t need to configure these components themselves.

The following properties and methods provide access to input and tracking data:

### Static Properties

- `LocalAvatarInput`: Gets the local avatar's input component that can be used to query for controller input data.

### Properties

- `EnabledControllerInputs`: Provides a list of enabled controller input devices associated with the avatar.
- `TrackingDevices`: Returns the list of tracking devices for the avatar.
- `FirstControllerTracking`: Gets the first tracking device associated to controllers for the avatar.
- `CameraTrackingEnabled`: Controls whether the avatar’s camera tracking is currently enabled.

### Methods

- `GetControllerInputForward()`: Returns the forward vector of a controller input, useful for determining direction in VR.

### Examples

Example that uses `LocalAvatarInput` to check, from anywhere in the code, whether the right trigger button is being pressed:
```c#
bool isRightTriggerPressed = UxrAvatar.LocalAvatarInput.GetButtonsPressDown(UxrHandSide.Right, UxrInputButtons.Trigger);
```

## Locomotion

Avatar movement is managed through locomotion components that are added to the avatar. Some default locomotion components are included under the **HandsIntegration** GameObject, which is present on all avatars to provide built-in functionality.

You can retrieve locomotion components through enumeration because `UxrLocomotion` inherits from `UxrAvatarComponent<UxrLocomotion>`.

For example:
```c#
IEnumerable<UxrLocomotion> allLocomotions = UxrLocomotion.GetComponents(UxrAvatar.LocalAvatar, true);
IEnumerable<UxrTeleportLocomotion> enabledTeleportsOnly = UxrLocomotion.GetComponents(UxrAvatar.LocalAvatar).OfType<UxrTeleportLocomotion>();
```

### Methods

- `EnableLocomotion()`: Enables or disables locomotion for the avatar, allowing or preventing movement.

## Hand Poses

Hand poses are predefined finger configurations used for actions like gestures or object grabbing, created using the [Hand Pose Editor](/docs/avatars/the-hand-pose-editor).

There are two types of hand poses: Fixed and Blend. Fixed poses are a single static configuration, while Blend poses allow any configuration between a start and end pose, controlled by a blend factor between 0 and 1. Blend poses are especially useful for adjusting grab poses to fit different object sizes, although they can be used for animations too.

When changing the current hand pose, you can choose whether to transition smoothly or apply the change instantly.

### Properties

- `DefaultHandPoseName`: Gets the default hand pose used by the avatar when no specific pose is assigned.

### Methods

- `GetAllHandPoses()`: Retrieves all defined hand poses available for the avatar, including those inherited from parent prefabs.
- `GetHandPoses()`: Retrieves all defined hand poses available for the avatar, excluding those inherited from parent prefabs.
- `GetHandPose()`: Returns a specific hand pose based on the input parameters.
- `IsHandPoseOverriden()`: Checks whether a specific hand pose has been overridden for the avatar.
- `GetRuntimeHandPose()`: Retrieves the runtime hand pose currently being used by the avatar.
- `GetCurrentRuntimeHandPose()`: Returns the current runtime hand pose for either the left or right hand.
- `GetCurrentHandPoseBlendValue()`: Gets the current blend value between two hand poses.
- `SetCurrentHandPose()`: Assigns a new hand pose to the avatar for either the left or right hand.
- `SetCurrentHandPoseBlendValue()`: Sets the blend value between two hand poses.
- `SetCurrentHandPoseImmediately()`: Sets the avatar’s hand pose immediately without blending.

## Manipulation

Object manipulation is a core feature in UltimateXR. Avatars can grab objects using the `UxrGrabber` component, which is attached to specific points on their hands.

You can learn more about the mechanics in the [user guide](/docs/manipulation/overview), and they can also be controlled programmatically, as detailed in the [Programming Guide](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/overview).

### Properties

- `LeftGrabber`: Accesses the grabber component for the avatar's left hand, responsible for handling interactions like picking up objects.
- `RightGrabber`: Accesses the grabber component for the avatar's right hand, responsible for handling interactions like picking up objects.

### Methods

- `GetGrabber()`: Accesses the grabber component for any of the avatar's hands.

## UI

The UI system in UltimateXR allows avatars to interact with user interfaces using their hands. Components like fingertip interaction and laser pointers are available to enable precise control of UI elements. You can enable or disable these interaction modes based on the needs of your application.

### Properties

- `FingerTips`: Gets all the enabled `UxrFingerTip` components in the avatar.
- `LaserPointers`: Gets all the enabled `UxrLaserPointer` components in the avatar.

### Methods

- `EnableFingerTips()`: Enables or disables the user of `UxrFingerTip` components in the avatar.
- `EnableLaserPointers()`: Enables or disables the user of `UxrLaserPointer` components in the avatar.

## Prefab Info

UltimateXR avatars are based on prefabs. The system can manage prefab variants, track parent prefabs, and check compatibility to reuse grab poses during manipulation.

The use of prefabs and prefab variants makes the customization and reuse of avatars easier.

### Properties

- `PrefabGuid`: Gets the avatar prefab Guid.
- `ParentPrefab`: Gets the parent prefab `GameObject`, if it exists.
- `ParentAvatarPrefab`: Gets the `UxrAvatar` component in `ParentPrefab`, if it exists.
- `IsPrefabVariant`: Gets whether the avatar's prefab has a parent avatar prefab.

### Methods

- `GetAvatarChain()`: Gets the chain of `UxrAvatar` components upwards in the prefab hierarchy.
- `GetPrefabGuidChain()`: Gets the Guids of all prefabs upwards in the prefab hierarchy.
- `GetParentPrefabChain()`: Gets the chain of `UxrAvatar` components upwards in the prefab hierarchy, starting from the parent.
- `GetParentPrefab()`: Gets the parent prefab that stores a given hand pose.
- `IsPrefabCompatibleWith()`: Checks whether the avatar shares the same prefab or is a prefab variant of another avatar.

## Avatar Events

Avatar events let developers respond to specific actions or changes related to avatars, such as when an avatar is spawned, it moved, or hand poses are switched.

### Static Events

- `LocalAvatarStarted`: Raised right after the local avatar called its `Start()`.
- `LocalAvatarChanged`: Raised right after the local avatar changed. This is useful when the avatar is instantiated in a deferred way, such as a networking environment, and the avatar isn't ready during `Awake()`/`OnEnable()`/`Start()`.
- `GlobalAvatarMoving`: Raised right before **any** avatar is about to be moved.
- `GlobalAvatarMoved`: Raised right after **any** avatar moved.

### Non-Static Events

- `HandPoseChanging`: Raised right before the avatar is about to change a hand's pose.
- `HandPoseChanged`: Raised right after the avatar changed a hand's pose.
- `AvatarUpdating`: Raised right before the avatar goes through an `UxrUpdateStage` of the updating process.
- `AvatarUpdated`: Raised right after the avatar goes through an `UxrUpdateStage` of the updating process.
