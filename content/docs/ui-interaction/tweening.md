# Tweening

UltimateXR comes with a full UI tweening animation system. It supports animation and setup both using the inspector and through scripting. 

The full set of tweening animation components are:

- `UxrCanvasAlphaTween`
- `UxrColorTween`
- `UxrImageFillTween`
- `UxrPositionTween`
- `UxrRotationTween`
- `UxrScaleTween`
- `UxrTextContentTween`

They can be added to the different elements in a UI and will perform the given animation when enabled.

For examples of use via scripting go to [How do I?](/docs/guides/scripting-how-do-i#ui)

You can also check the full tweening API [here](/api/N_UltimateXR_Animation_UI).
