# Example scene

Once you've installed UltimateXR and completed the integration for your headset, it's highly recommended to begin by exploring the example scene. Located under UltimateXR/Examples/Fullscene, it provides a practical demonstration of how virtual reality mechanics are constructed by examining a fully functional project.

And it is optimized for mobile headsets!

Understanding all the intricacies may require some time and patience. The scene itself is the culmination of numerous iterations, extensive testing, and meticulous refinement. We've invested significant effort into crafting it, and we understand that learning everything at once can be overwhelming.

Keep an eye out for regular updates, as new features will be periodically added to introduce new mechanics and functionalities.

While the example scene currently targets the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), we're actively working to extend support to other pipelines such as the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) in the near future. Stay tuned for more updates on this front!
