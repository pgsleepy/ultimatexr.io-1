# About UltimateXR

UltimateXR is an open-source framework and toolkit for Unity, designed to make virtual reality development easier. It was created by a team with over 20 years of experience in computer graphics, simulation, and video games. The project started in 2016 as the foundation for our virtual reality company, VRMADA, with a clear goal: to build a high-quality, scalable framework that speeds up development while delivering great user experiences, interactivity, and immersion.

From the beginning, we wanted to share UltimateXR with the community. After years of successful projects and thorough testing, we’re excited to make it available as a free, open-source solution.

Why free and open-source? Because we want to make a difference. Virtual reality is our passion, and we believe in empowering all developers, from indie creators to corporate teams, as well as supporting academic institutions in teaching VR. By offering accessible tools and resources, we aim to open up VR development to everyone.

Offering our framework as open-source is a big step, but we’re committed to improving it with each update, making it the go-to framework for VR creation.
